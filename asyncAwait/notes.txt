async/await is a modern way to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript, 
making it easier to read and write compared to callbacks or promises.

An async function always returns a promise.
Inside an async function, you use await to wait for a promise to resolve.
Error handling is done with try...catch.


Since async functions return a promise, calling greet() returns a promise, so we use .then() to log the result.
